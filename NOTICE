This is an historical snapshot of the bulk of the last Inferno source tree received by Vita Nuova
in mid 1999 from Lucent's Inferno Business Unit, which was being shut down.
It is not intended to be usable, nor is it intended that it run or even compile on any current platform.
It was Lucent's Release 2.3 Build 265i.
In Vita Nuova's naming, it corresponds to Inferno Second Edition.
Vita Nuova had been involved in Inferno development as an Inferno customer since 1996,
and as contractors to the Business Unit since 1997 (starting with the first PowerPC port).
It acquired rights to Inferno from Lucent in March 2000, and produced its own Inferno
release as Inferno Third Edition ca. July 2000.
Until that release, Inferno was not normally distributed in complete source form, even to
native port customers (hence the Dist.a archive references in os).
Thus, this historical distribution will for many be the first sight of the source as it then was.

It excludes various proprietary ports and other material that were in the source tree we received.
It also excludes the fonts to save space.
