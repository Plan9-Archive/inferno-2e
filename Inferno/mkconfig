#	Set the following 3 variables.  The host system is the system where
#	the software will be built; the target system is where it will run.
#	They are almost always the same.

#	On Nt systems, the ROOT path MUST be of the form `drive:/path'
ROOT=$HOME/inf2.3

#	specify (host) OS type and (target) architecture.  The target OS type
#	defaults to the same as the host, but both target parameters are
#	overridden automatically when building native kernels.
#
SYSHOST=Inferno		# build system OS type (Hp, Inferno, Irix, Linux, Nt, Plan9, Solaris)
OBJTYPE=$objtype		# target system object type (s800, mips, 386, arm, sparc)

#
#	no changes required beyond this point

SYSTARG=$SYSHOST	# target system OS type.  Native builds override this.
OBJDIR=$SYSTARG/$OBJTYPE

<$ROOT/mkfiles/mkfile-$SYSTARG-$OBJTYPE	# variables used to build target object type
