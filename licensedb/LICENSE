LIMITED USE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR INFERNO(TM) SOFTWARE

THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS  AGREEMENT  WILL  APPLY  TO  THE
SOFTWARE  FURNISHED BY CD ROM, ELECTRONIC DOWNLOAD OR OTHER MEANS
AND DERIVATIVES OBTAINED THEREFROM, INCLUDING ANY COPIES. IF  YOU
DON'T AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT,
YOU MAY RETURN THE SOFTWARE UNUSED FOR A REFUND WITHIN  TEN  (10)
DAYS  OF PURCHASE. The term "SOFTWARE" includes COMPUTER programs
and related  documentation  supplied  herewith  and  any  updates
subsequently provided by LUCENT.

1. Title and License Grant

     A. The SOFTWARE is copyrighted and/or  contains  proprietary
     information  protected by law. Ownership of and title to all
     SOFTWARE  and  all  copies  thereof,  including   associated
     intellectual  property  rights,  are  and  will  remain with
     LUCENT or its suppliers. In consideration of the monies paid
     by you and your agreeing to the terms and conditions of this
     Agreement, LUCENT hereby grants you a limited  non-exclusive
     right  to  use  the  SOFTWARE  in  object  code form only as
     authorized in this Agreement. Any other use of the  SOFTWARE
     or  removal  of  the SOFTWARE from a country in which use is
     licensed shall  automatically  terminate  this  license.  No
     right is granted to use the SOFTWARE in any product which is
     marketed or used commercially.

     B. Use of the SOFTWARE anywhere except  in  the  country  in
     which the SOFTWARE is provided may, in addition to the terms
     and conditions of this Agreement, be subject  to  the  terms
     and conditions of a separate written agreement signed by you
     or the user. You acknowledge that the SOFTWARE is subject to
     U.S.  export  laws  and  regulations and any use or transfer
     must be authorized under those regulations. You  agree  that
     you  will  not  use,  distribute,  transfer, or transmit the
     SOFTWARE, or technical  information  (even  if  incorporated
     into  other products), except in compliance with U.S. export
     regulations.

     C. You agree to use your best efforts to see that  any  user
     of  the  SOFTWARE licensed hereunder complies with the terms
     and conditions of this Agreement and to refrain from  taking
     any  steps, such as reverse engineering, reverse assembly or
     reverse compilation, to derive a source code  equivalent  of
     the  SOFTWARE.  If  the  SOFTWARE is located in the European
     Community and you assert that you have a right to  and  need
     for     information     "indispensable     for     achieving
     interoperability  of  an  independently   created   computer
     program"  with  the SOFTWARE, you shall submit a request for
     such information to LUCENT prior to undertaking any steps to
     reverse  engineer,  reverse  assemble or reverse compile the
     SOFTWARE.  The  meaning  of  "indispensable  for   achieving
     interoperability"  shall  be interpreted pursuant to Article
     VI of the European  Community  Computer  Software  Directive
     91/205.  If  the  information  is  deemed  indispensable  by
     LUCENT, LUCENT will (a) provide such  information  within  a
     reasonable  period  of  time  or (b) advise you that you may
     decompile  the   SOFTWARE   pursuant   to   guidelines.   If
     information  is  provided under option (a) above, you may be
     charged a fee.

2. Software Use

     A. You are permitted to make a single archive copy, provided
     the  SOFTWARE  shall not otherwise be reproduced, copied or,
     except for the documentation, disclosed to others  in  whole
     or  in  part  except  as  explicitly provided herein. If you
     install the SOFTWARE on  a  client-server  system,  you  may
     install  the SOFTWARE on up to two (2) servers, each with up
     to ten (10) subtended clients. Any such copy  shall  contain
     the same copyright notice and proprietary marking, including
     CD ROM markings, appearing on the original SOFTWARE.

     B. The SOFTWARE, together with any copies thereof, shall  be
     destroyed  when  no  longer  used  in  accordance  with this
     Agreement,  or  when  the  right  to  use  the  SOFTWARE  is
     terminated. The SOFTWARE shall not be removed from a country
     in which use is licensed.

     C. You understand and acknowledge that  the  nature  of  the
     SOFTWARE  is such that in its normal operation it may access
     and download elements of software  or  data  from  resources
     which  are  external  to  the computer or device running the
     SOFTWARE, such as Inferno enabled servers. LUCENT  does  not
     undertake  to provide such external resources or servers and
     specifically disclaims any representation or warranty as  to
     the  availability,  quality or performance of such resources
     or whether they may contain any  defects  which  may  affect
     performance  of  the SOFTWARE or your computer. LUCENT shall
     not be  responsible  for  provision  of  any  communications
     facilities  or the costs associated with communications. You
     understand and acknowledge that  the  SOFTWARE  may  contain
     expiration  routines  which will disable the SOFTWARE at the
     expiration of this Agreement.

3. Limited Warranty

     A. LUCENT warrants for a period of ninety (90) days from the
     date  purchased,  for your benefit alone, that if the CD ROM
     containing  the  SOFTWARE  has  a  defect  in  material   or
     workmanship  or  the SOFTWARE fails to substantially conform
     to the specifications in the related documentation, you  may
     return  the SOFTWARE to the place from which it is purchased
     within such warranty period for replacement or, at  LUCENT's
     option  and upon return of all copies of the SOFTWARE, for a
     refund of the monies paid by you under this Agreement.

     B. LUCENT has used reasonable efforts to minimize defects or
     errors  in the SOFTWARE. However, you assume the risk of any
     and all damage or loss from use of, or inability to use, the
     SOFTWARE.  LUCENT  specifically  does  not  warrant that the
     functions of the SOFTWARE will  meet  your  requirements  or
     that SOFTWARE operation will be error-free or uninterrupted.

     C. EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE,  THE
     SOFTWARE  IS  LICENSED  "AS  IS" AND LUCENT, ITS AFFILIATES,
     CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS AND AGENTS MAKE NO OTHER  WARRANTIES,
     EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY
     OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE  OR
     ANY WARRANTY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NONINFRINGEMENT.

4. Exclusive Remedies and Limitations of Liabilities

     A. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE  AND  EXCLUSIVE  REMEDY  AGAINST
     LUCENT,  ITS  AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, AND AGENTS
     FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANY DEFECT OR  FAILURE  IN  THE
     SOFTWARE  REGARDLESS  OF  THE  FORM  OF  ACTION,  WHETHER IN
     CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE,  STRICT  LIABILITY  OR
     OTHERWISE, SHALL BE REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE OR REFUND OF
     MONIES PAID AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS  AGREEMENT.  THIS
     SHALL  BE  EXCLUSIVE  OF  ANY AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES AGAINST
     LUCENT, ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS,  SUPPLIERS  OR  AGENTS,
     EXCEPT  FOR YOUR RIGHT TO CLAIM DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY TO
     ANY PERSON.

     B. Regardless of any other  provisions  of  this  Agreement,
     neither LUCENT nor its affiliates, contractors, suppliers or
     agents shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special
     or  consequential damages (including lost profits) sustained
     or incurred  in  connection  with  the  use,  operation,  or
     inability  to  use the SOFTWARE or for damages due to causes
     beyond the reasonable control  of  LUCENT,  its  affiliates,
     contractors,   suppliers  and  agents  attributable  to  any
     service, products or action of any other person.

     C. Some states or  other  jurisdictions  do  not  allow  the
     exclusion  of  implied warranties or limitations on how long
     an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may  not
     apply  to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights
     and you may also have other rights which vary from one state
     or jurisdiction to another.

5. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     A. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with  and
     governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding its
     conflict of laws rules.

     B. U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS. If you are acquiring SOFTWARE  on
     behalf  of  any  part  of  the United States Government, the
     following provisions apply: The SOFTWARE  is  deemed  to  be
     "commercial     software"     and    "commercial    software
     documentation,"  respectively,  pursuant  to  DFAR   Section
     227.7202   and   FAR   12.212,   as   applicable.  Any  use,
     modification, reproduction, release, performance, display or
     disclosure  of the SOFTWARE by the U.S. Government or any of
     its agencies shall be governed solely by the terms  of  this
     Agreement  and  shall  be  prohibited  except  to the extent
     expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

     C. Inferno is a trademark of LUCENT and no right, license or
     interest  in  or to such trademark is granted hereunder. You
     agree that no such  right,  license  or  interest  shall  be
     asserted by you with respect to such trademark.

     D. LUCENT hereby grants you  an  immunity  from  suit  under
     LUCENT's  present patents solely with respect to your use of
     the SOFTWARE in accordance to the terms  and  conditions  of
     this  Agreement  and  not  in  combination  with  any  other
     software or hardware. It is recognized  that  third  parties
     may  have patents that might be infringed by your use of the
     SOFTWARE and LUCENT makes no representations  or  warranties
     with  respect  thereto. It shall be your sole responsibility
     to determine the existence and applicability of  patents  of
     third  parties  and  to  secure  any  necessary license with
     respect thereto.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND  UNDERSTAND
IT,  AND THAT BY INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE (OR AUTHORIZING
ANY OTHER PERSON TO DO SO) YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.  YOU  FURTHER  AGREE  THAT,  EXCEPT  FOR ANY SEPARATE
WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LUCENT AND YOU, THIS AGREEMENT IS  THE
COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF
THE PARTIES. THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES ALL PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS,
PROPOSALS OR UNDERSTANDINGS, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN
US RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS AGREEMENT.
