#
#	Set the following 3 variables:
#
#	Absolute path to the root of the source tree.  On Nt systems, 
#	the ROOT path MUST be of the form `ROOT=drive:/path'
#
ROOT=$HOME/inf2.3

#
#	Specify host OS type and architecture.  The host system is the 
#	system where the software will be built.  $SYSHOST always means
#	the OS of the build host, and $OBJTYPE is as the processor of the 
#	build host.  
#
SYSHOST=Solaris		# build system OS type (Hp, Inferno, Irix, Linux, Nt, Plan9, Solaris)
OBJTYPE=sparc		# build system processor type (s800, mips, 386, sparc) 

#
#	No changes required beyond this point
#
SYSTARG=$SYSHOST	# target system OS type.  Native builds override this.
OBJDIR=$SYSTARG/$OBJTYPE

<$ROOT/mkfiles/mkhost-$SYSHOST		# variables appropriate for host system
<$ROOT/mkfiles/mkfile-$SYSTARG-$OBJTYPE	# variables used to build target object type
